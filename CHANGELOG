# 0.3.3 (Skipped 0.3.2)

- adds `querySchema` beside `schema` to validate incoming query strings - same interface and features as body schema validation

# 0.3.1

- allows `ctx.status = 204`; router will set `ctx.body = ''` for you.
- `propagateErrors` call allows full error messages to be returned for any environment other than `staging` and `production`.

# 0.3.0

- order of middleware shifted slightly:

  Router level middleware (the `middleware(deps) => Middleware[]`) will occur BEFORE schema validation, instead of after.
  
# 0.2.2

- adds `JSONSchema.load('schemaName', path.join(__dirname, '../my-schema-dir'))` which loads 'my-schema-dir/schemaName.json'

# 0.2.1

- quickfix for types

# 0.2.0

- API interface was changed slightly to allow better testing of your routes

Note: This is only a breaking change if you were calling many of the route building functions directly.
      Regular use of router would not be impacted by this.
      
# 0.1.12

- `return false` in a route action sets `ctx.status = 204` for you.
